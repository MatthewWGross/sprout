# sprout

This is a side project to knock the rust off of my C++

#Technical Details:
---Simple batch build to compile rather than using VS
---C/C++ 
---Data-Driven loading of Map, entities, etc...
---Details of things stored in a Database (Mongo? SQL?... not sure yet)
---Proper Save/Load serialization
---OpenGL Renderer

#Secondary Possible features
---In-world editor to manipulate and change environment
---Reflection system (Either via macros or generated via markup)
---Tooling in Python (I want to get to know it better)
---Server/Client model?  It'd be fun to have a persistant version of it running and updating even if it's only local or on a RaspberryPi
