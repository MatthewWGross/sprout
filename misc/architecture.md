Some ideas for architecture:

# Platform Layer
 * Windows
 * Input
 * 

Notes:
 * Utilize intermediate structures for communication with platform layer

# Utilities
 * Serialization of Assets
   * What are assets? What data types need to be created?
 * Debug Rendering
 * Profiling tools


 # Engine Systems
 * Object model? How are entities represented?
 * Physics system? at least collision detection and movement. 
 * Networking layer to communication with server/services


 # Game Systems
 * UI
 *
